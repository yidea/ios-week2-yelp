# Yelp
### Search results page
- [x] Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height
- [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints
- [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

**Optional**

- [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results
- [ ] Implement map view of restaurant results

### Filter page

- [ ] The filters you should actually have are: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), radius (meters), deals (on/off).
- [ ] The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
- [ ] You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states. Optional: implement a custom switch
- [ ] Radius filter should expand as in the real Yelp app
- [ ] Categories should show a subset of the full list with a "See All" row to expand. Category list is here: http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/category_list (Links to an external site.)
- [ ] Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.

**Optional**

- [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page.

## Other Optional Explorations

- [x] Autocomplete that suggests categories
